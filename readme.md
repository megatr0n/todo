# Laravel Quickstart - Intermediate - Task List With Authentication



System requirements:

Laravel 5.2.,
PHP 7.2.22,
composer 2.5.5


Installation:

 Clone its Git repository and install its dependencies to your 
 local machine. Or just download and copy files to your server's 
 document root(htdoc,public_html...).
 



Remarks:

I couldn't get php version 8 to work with the latest Laravel version 9.
So, I had to settle for what works and has available documentation. 



How to use this to-do-list application:


1) Execute "php artisan serve --port=8000".

2) Then navigate to localhost:8000 or go to http://localhost/todo/public/index.php.

3) First, you will need to create at least one project.

4) Click the ">>Project<<" link at the top of the page. Once that page is fully loaded, create a project.

5) Now you are ready to create tasks and assign them to projects.

6) Click the ">>Task<<" link at the top of the page. Once that page is fully loaded, create a task and assign it to a prject.
